# Registration APIs

This project contains all the components needed to implement the Registration API, a Flask webserver running on the Edge, providing REST APIs to interact with a dataflow database.

## Interactions

The registration apis interract with:
- the Cloud Dataflow DB, to add informations about the active dataflows;
- the S&D application, retrieving from POST request the information about new dataflows;
- the S&D application, retrieving from PUT requests the dataflows keepalives.

## API Description

The yaml description of the APIs is provided in the [api](https://github.com/5gmeta/registration/tree/main/api) folder.   
The provided endpoints are:

- **POST /dataflows**, that receives the dataflow metadata as body in the request, adds the new dataflow to the DB and returns a JSON; this JSON contains:
    - the dataflowId;
    - the amqp topic where to send the messages;
    - a boolean value called "send", if "send" is True, at least one consumer in the 5GMETA platform is interested in the dataflow registered.
- **PUT /dataflows/\<dataflowId\>**, that receives the dataflow metadata as body in the request and performs several operations:
    - modifies the metadata associated to a specific dataflow; 
    - functions as a keepalive, if the sender does not send this PUT periodically (every 30/60 seconds), 5GMETA will delete the dataflow; 
    - generates the same response as the POST /dataflow, but may update the "send" value if the consumers change.
- **DELETE /dataflows/\<dataflowId\>**, that deletes a specific dataflow.
